## About Richard Marks

I’m a hard-working, reliable and trustworthy US-based developer who is open and honest about everything I do. I know how to get things done. 

Computers have been my focus in life for the last 29 years and I have many completed projects under my belt and I possess a vast in-depth knowledge of computers and software.

Since 1988 I have developed software and games for a variety of platforms using many languages including C++, C#, ActionScript 3.0, Python, Lua, Java Ruby, and JavaScript. I have experience with engineering code using design patterns and using UML to communicate such constructions.

I am a professional artist. I have considerable skill with both 2D and 3D applications including Adobe Photoshop CS5, Adobe Illustrator CS5, Blender, 3ds max 2012, Maya 2012, Cinema4D, Wings3D, GIMP and Inkscape to name just a few.

I have done lettering and typography for comics, books, flyers, brochures, etc...

I’m a bit of a hobbyist musician. I play guitar, and enjoy using sample-based tracking software for creating rich aural experiences.

I’m the guy who everyone comes to for help. As a technology educator, I have paved the way for hundreds of new software developers.
